        one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and
        most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.</i

        The Milky Way is but one of billions of galaxies in the observable
        universe — all of them, including our own, are thought to have
        supermassive black holes at their centers.</strike

        All the stars in all the galaxies and all the other stuff that
        astronomers can't even observe are all part of the universe. It is,
        simply, everything.

        Wherever you are right now, outer space is only 62 miles (100
        kilometers) away. Day or night, whether you’re indoors or outdoors,
        asleep, eating lunch or dozing off in class, outer space is just a few
        dozen miles above your head. It’s below you too. About 8,000 miles
        (12,800 kilometers) below your feet — on the opposite side of Earth —
        lurks the unforgiving vacuum and radiation of outer space.</mark

      In fact, you’re technically in space right now. Humans say “out in space”
      as if it’s there and we’re here, as if Earth is separate from the rest of
      the universe.
      <abbr title="Our lovely planet">But Earth is a planet</abbr>, and it’s in
      space and part of the universe just like the other planets. It just so
      happens that things live here and the environment near the surface of this
      particular planet is hospitable for life as we know it. Earth is a tiny,
      fragile exception in the cosmos. For humans and the other things living on
      our planet, practically the entire cosmos is a hostile and merciless
      environment.
